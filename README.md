# Serv's Breeding Dice Game

Some spaghetti I whipped up and turned into a website to play silly breeding dice/RP games.

The game this site, in particular, is based on is the one found on Taji's [profile on f-list](https://www.f-list.net/c/taji%20amatsukaze/).

Want to help make it less cringe or even better/more fun? Throw up a pull request or [shoot me a note on f-list](https://www.f-list.net/c/serv/)!
